## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or higher
- rsync (for file transfers)
- SSH access to your media server

### Quick Start (Linux)

The startup script will automatically handle virtual environment setup:

1. **Clone or download the project**:
   ```bash
   cd dragoncp_ui
   ```

2. **Give execute permission to the startup script**:
   ```bash
   chmod u+x start.sh
   ```

3. **Run the startup script**:
   ```bash
   ./start.sh
   ```

4. **Follow the prompts**:
   - The script will detect if a virtual environment exists
   - If not found, it will offer to create one
   - Dependencies will be automatically installed
   - Configuration will be set up

5. **Access the web interface**:
   - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5000`
   - The interface will be available on all network interfaces

For detailed setup instructions, manual installation, troubleshooting, and development information, see [SETUP.md](SETUP.md).

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `dragoncp_env.env` file in the project root directory (same location as `app.py`) with the following variables:

```env
# Flask Application Settings
SECRET_KEY="your-secret-key-here-change-this-in-production"

# Remote Server Connection Details
REMOTE_IP="your-server-ip"
REMOTE_USER="your-username"
REMOTE_PASSWORD="your-password-here"
SSH_KEY_PATH="/path/to/your/private/key"

# Media Source Paths on Remote Server
MOVIE_PATH="/path/to/movies"
TVSHOW_PATH="/path/to/tvshows"
ANIME_PATH="/path/to/anime"

# Local Destination Paths
MOVIE_DEST_PATH="/local/path/to/movies"
TVSHOW_DEST_PATH="/local/path/to/tvshows"
ANIME_DEST_PATH="/local/path/to/anime"

# Backup Path for rsync
BACKUP_PATH="/path/to/backup"

# Disk Usage Monitoring (optional)
DISK_PATH_1="/path/to/monitor"
DISK_PATH_2="/another/path/to/monitor"
DISK_PATH_3="/third/path/to/monitor"

# Remote disk usage API (optional)
DISK_API_ENDPOINT="https://api.example.com/disk-usage"
DISK_API_TOKEN="your_bearer_token_here"
```

**Note**: The environment file must be placed in the project root directory (same folder as `app.py`). The application will only look for `dragoncp_env.env` in this specific location.

### Quick Setup

1. Copy the sample environment file:
   ```bash
   cp dragoncp_env_sample.env dragoncp_env.env
   ```

2. Edit `dragoncp_env.env` with your actual configuration values

3. The application will automatically load the configuration when started

### SSH Authentication

You can connect using either:
- **Password authentication**: Enter username and password in the web interface
- **SSH key authentication**: Provide the path to your private key file

## Usage

### 1. Connect to Server
- Enter your server details (IP/hostname, username, password or SSH key path)
- Click "Connect" to establish SSH connection

### 2. Select Media Type
- Choose from Movies, TV Shows, or Anime
- The interface will load available folders from your configured paths

### 3. Browse and Select
- Navigate through folders and seasons using the breadcrumb navigation
- For TV Shows and Anime, you'll see season folders
- For Movies, you'll see movie folders directly

### 4. Transfer Options

#### Sync Entire Folder
- Transfers all content from the selected folder/season
- Uses optimized rsync settings for large media files

#### Manual Episode Sync
- Browse available episodes in a season
- Select specific episodes to download
- Useful for updating individual episodes

#### Download Single Episode
- Direct download of a specific episode
- Creates necessary directories automatically

### 5. Monitor Transfers
- Real-time progress updates via WebSocket
- Transfer logs with detailed rsync output
- Ability to cancel running transfers
- Progress bars and status indicators
- Persistent transfer history in database
- Resume interrupted transfers
