- Configuration panel for path settings

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or higher
- rsync (for file transfers)
- SSH access to your media server

### Quick Start (Recommended)

The startup scripts will automatically handle virtual environment setup:

1. **Clone or download the project**:
   ```bash
   cd dragoncp_ui
   ```

2. **Run the startup script**:
   ```bash
   # On Linux/Mac:
   ./start.sh
   
   # On Windows:
   start.bat
   
   # Or use the Python script (works on all platforms):
   python3 start.py
   ```

3. **Follow the prompts**:
   - The script will detect if a virtual environment exists
   - If not found, it will offer to create one
   - Dependencies will be automatically installed
   - Configuration will be set up

4. **Access the web interface**:
   - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5000`
   - The interface will be available on all network interfaces

### Manual Setup (Alternative)

If you prefer to set up the virtual environment manually:

1. **Create virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

2. **Activate virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   # On Linux/Mac:
   source venv/bin/activate
   
   # On Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

### Using the Setup Script

For a guided setup experience:

```bash
python3 setup_venv.py
```

This script will:
- Check for existing virtual environments
- Create a new one if needed
- Install all dependencies
- Verify the installation

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `dragoncp_env.env` file in the project root directory (same location as `app.py`) with the following variables:

```env
# Server connection details
REMOTE_IP="your-server-ip"
REMOTE_USER="your-username"

# Media paths on the server
MOVIE_PATH="/path/to/movies"
TVSHOW_PATH="/path/to/tvshows"
ANIME_PATH="/path/to/anime"

# Local destination paths
MOVIE_DEST_PATH="/local/path/to/movies"
TVSHOW_DEST_PATH="/local/path/to/tvshows"
ANIME_DEST_PATH="/local/path/to/anime"

# Backup path for rsync
BACKUP_PATH="/path/to/backup"
```

**Note**: The environment file must be placed in the project root directory (same folder as `app.py`). The application will only look for `dragoncp_env.env` in this specific location.

### Quick Setup

1. Copy the sample environment file:
   ```bash
   cp dragoncp_env_sample.env dragoncp_env.env
   ```

2. Edit `dragoncp_env.env` with your actual configuration values

3. The application will automatically load the configuration when started

### SSH Authentication

You can connect using either:
- **Password authentication**: Enter username and password in the web interface
- **SSH key authentication**: Provide the path to your private key file

## Usage

### 1. Connect to Server
- Enter your server details (IP/hostname, username, password or SSH key path)
- Click "Connect" to establish SSH connection

### 2. Select Media Type
- Choose from Movies, TV Shows, or Anime
- The interface will load available folders from your configured paths

### 3. Browse and Select
- Navigate through folders and seasons using the breadcrumb navigation
- For TV Shows and Anime, you'll see season folders
- For Movies, you'll see movie folders directly

### 4. Transfer Options

#### Sync Entire Folder
- Transfers all content from the selected folder/season
- Uses optimized rsync settings for large media files

#### Manual Episode Sync
- Browse available episodes in a season
- Select specific episodes to download
- Useful for updating individual episodes

#### Download Single Episode
- Direct download of a specific episode
- Creates necessary directories automatically

### 5. Monitor Transfers
- Real-time progress updates via WebSocket
- Transfer logs with detailed rsync output
- Ability to cancel running transfers
- Progress bars and status indicators

## Virtual Environment Management

### Automatic Detection

The startup scripts automatically detect virtual environments in these locations:
- `venv/` (default)
- `env/`
- `.venv/`
- `.env/`

### Creating a Virtual Environment

The startup scripts will offer to create a virtual environment if none is found. This is the recommended approach as it:

- Isolates dependencies from your system Python
- Prevents conflicts with other projects
- Makes the project more portable
- Follows Python best practices

### Manual Virtual Environment Management

If you need to manage the virtual environment manually:

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate (Linux/Mac)
source venv/bin/activate

# Activate (Windows)
venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Deactivate when done
deactivate
```

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Backend**: Flask with Flask-SocketIO for real-time communication
- **Frontend**: Modern HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript with Bootstrap 5
- **SSH**: Paramiko library for secure server connections
- **File Transfer**: rsync with optimized settings for media files
- **Environment**: Python virtual environment support

### Security Features
- SSH key and password authentication support
- Secure WebSocket connections
- Input validation and sanitization
- Session management
- Isolated Python environment

### Performance Optimizations
- Optimized rsync settings for large media files
- Asynchronous transfer monitoring
- Efficient folder browsing with caching
- Mobile-optimized UI components
- Virtual environment isolation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Connection Failed**
   - Verify server IP and credentials
   - Check SSH service is running on server
   - Ensure firewall allows SSH connections

2. **Transfer Fails**
   - Verify rsync is installed on both systems
   - Check file permissions on source and destination
   - Ensure sufficient disk space

3. **WebSocket Connection Issues**
   - Check if port 5000 is accessible
   - Verify firewall settings
   - Try accessing via localhost first

4. **Virtual Environment Issues**
   - Ensure Python 3.12+ is installed
   - Try recreating the virtual environment: `python3 setup_venv.py`
   - Check if venv module is available: `python3 -m venv --help`

### Logs
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Monitor Python console output for backend errors
- Transfer logs are displayed in real-time in the web interface
